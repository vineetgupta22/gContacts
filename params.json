I am not going to write code about\r\nthat but starting the code from where others left. Simply, there is \r\nmany solutions available about fetching but only Single Library available\r\nto Read Contacts i.e. Zend (zfs). This library could be used to create\r\nbase for reading gContacts XML/Atom Feed provided by Google.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Directories\r\n----\r\nI believe that there are two types of developers. One those who learn\r\nthings from manuals and source codes, other things and other are who learn\r\nfrom some other Developer and do things according to things learn by them.\r\nSo, I divided them as Developers and Developers Developer. Developers \r\nwant to know things as :\r\n - How to Do it?\r\n - What to Do it?\r\n - Where to Do it?\r\n - Has any Demo?\r\n - Minimum Requirements\r\n - etc.\r\n \r\nAll the question would be answered. So, I have divided the Project in two Projects. \r\nAs the **Project for Developers** and **Project for Demo**. If any body not interested in\r\nDemonstration things can skip this and go to folder dev provided in Project.\r\n\r\nFor Demo or Developers both need the root file i.e. gContacts.php. This main file imports\r\nLibrary, Functions and other things for working of the project. List of Directories:\r\n\r\n - lib [holding all the library files]\r\n - function [holding all the functions files]\r\n - template [holding the template for demo and viewing]\r\n - css [holding the style sheets for demo]\r\n - images [holding the images for demo]\r\n - dev [holding the set of developer settings]\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
