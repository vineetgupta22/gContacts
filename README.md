gContacts
=========

Google Importing Contacts to MySQL Database through PHP


Objective
---------

There are so many Library tutorials Available Online to tell you about
how to get your contacts from Google? I am not going to write code about
that but starting the code from where others left. Simply, there is 
many solutions available about fetching but only Single Library available
to Read Contacts i.e. Zend (zfs). This library could be used to create
base for reading gContacts XML/Atom Feed provided by Google.
