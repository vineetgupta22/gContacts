gContacts
=========

Google Importing Contacts to MySQL Database through PHP


Objective
---------

There are so many Library tutorials Available Online to tell you about
how to get your contacts from Google? I am not going to write code about
that but starting the code from where others left. Simply, there is 
many solutions available about fetching but only Single Library available
to Read Contacts i.e. Zend (zfs). This library could be used to create
base for reading gContacts XML/Atom Feed provided by Google.


Project Directories
----
I believe that there are two types of developers. One those who learn
things from manuals and source codes, other things and other are who learn
from some other Developer and do things according to things learn by them.
So, I divided them as Developers and Developers Developer. Developers 
want to know things as :
 - How to Do it?
 - What to Do it?
 - Where to Do it?
 - Has any Demo?
 - Minimum Requirements
 - etc.
 
All the question would be answered. So, I have divided the Project in two Projects. 
As the **Project for Developers** and **Project for Demo**. If any body not interested in
Demonstration things can skip this and go to folder dev provided in Project.

For Demo or Developers both need the root file i.e. gContacts.php. This main file imports
Library, Functions and other things for working of the project. List of Directories:

 - lib [holding all the library files]
 - function [holding all the functions files]
 - template [holding the template for demo and viewing]
 - css [holding the style sheets for demo]
 - images [holding the images for demo]
 - dev [holding the set of developer settings]
